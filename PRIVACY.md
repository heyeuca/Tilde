# Tilde Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 26, 2026_

Tilde is a text editor for macOS. Every document you open is processed entirely on your Mac.

## What Tilde collects

Nothing. Tilde does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage data.

- **No account.** There is no sign-in and no user profile.
- **No network access.** Tilde does not connect to any server, cloud storage, analytics, crash-reporting, or advertising service. The one exception is checking for updates, below, and only when you ask.
- **No tracking.** Tilde contains no analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs and does not use identifiers of any kind.

## Your documents

Tilde runs inside the macOS App Sandbox and reads and writes only the files you explicitly open or save, plus its own sandbox container. Documents never leave your Mac through Tilde. Standard macOS features such as Autosave, Versions, and Recent Documents are handled by the operating system according to your own system settings, with one exception: Tilde keeps its windows when you quit, unless you've chosen in System Settings → Desktop & Dock to close windows when quitting.

So that untitled documents come back after you quit, macOS keeps their text in Tilde's sandbox container on your Mac until you save the document or close its window. Closing the window without saving discards that copy.

## Checking for updates

The version downloaded from GitHub or installed with Homebrew has **Tilde → Check for Updates…**. Only when you choose it, Tilde downloads a small update feed from GitHub, and, if you choose to install an update, the new version from the same place. Like any web request, this shows GitHub your IP address and the app's version; it sends nothing about you or your documents. Tilde never checks on its own. The update mechanism is the open-source [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) framework, which collects no data.

The App Store version has no such command: the App Store updates it.

## Links you open

When you click a web link in Reader mode, macOS opens it in your default browser. Tilde does not record or forward the link. Once the browser opens, that site's own privacy policy applies.

## App Store

If you install Tilde from the Mac App Store, Apple may collect aggregated download and crash statistics under Apple's privacy policy. Tilde itself does not receive personal information from Apple.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be published at this address with a new date.
